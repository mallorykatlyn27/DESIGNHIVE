                          I spent the first 10 or so years of my career working in the medical field. While I can say that I did love helping people, I just wasn't fulfilled working under someone else any longer.
                        
                          One day I was trying to figure out how to add a table of contents to a OneNote Notebook, and ended up diving down the rabbithole of coding, and the rest is history!

                          Not that long, actually! I started my journey in early 2023, by taking a bunch of free courses online! As I learned more and more, I realized that this could be a very exciting, fun and lucrative business idea and once I realized I was actually good at it, I figured whats the worst that could happen if I just give it a shot?!

                            I think it's really more of a matter of learning the different coding "languages" needed and once you have a basic understanding of them, the rest is pretty easy, and FUN!!!

                          That really depends on what needs to be done. If you are looking for an incredibly detailed and responsive website, that process can take up to 8 weeks. My portfolio website was completed in roughly 3 weeks.

                          The answer to this can really vary. Keep in mind that you are not only looking at the cost of the design of your site, but also the cost to publish it on the internet. This typically requires a monthly or yearly fee, but within that fee, you are typically paying for your domain, some level of security for your page, and a certain amount of memory storage to store the webpage and its code.
